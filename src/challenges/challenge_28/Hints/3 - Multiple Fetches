Figuring out how to do this is the central challenge here, so give yourself some time to do some thinking, experimenting, and Googling. Then, if you're still stuck, scroll down to line 50 for some more hints (spoiler alert). 
















































You need to fetch data and add that data to the activities state array for each key. One way of doing this is to do exactly what that sentence says: fetch and add data *for each* key! In other words, use the forEach method to go through the keys one by one, fetch data for them, and do what you need to do with that data to add it to the state array (remembering to preserve any data that might already be there, since previous fetches and additions to the array may have already taken place).

Alternatively (and arguably more efficiently), you could map over the keys, create a new array that contains all of the objects you'll be adding to the state array, and then set them as the state array all at once. For this, the Promise.all() method will be very useful. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all
