Reading an API's documentation to understand how to use it is one of the primary challenges of working with an API, so give yourself some time to read the AP_Documentation.md file and think about what to do here. 

Remember that most times when you have to read documentation for anything coding-related, most of the documentation is irrelevant to the task at hand, so the key is to scan through the text, find the bit that is relevant, and ignore the rest. 

If you're still stuck after trying to do that, scroll down to line 50 for another hint (spoiler alert).












































Item 2 (Find an activity by its key) is the part of the documentation that is relevant to the task.
