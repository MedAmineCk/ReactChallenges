Remember that when you're fetching from an API when a page loads, you should execute the fetch in useEffect. 

You can use an array method to iterate through savedActivityKeys and fetch data for each key. 

You then need to convert that data from JSON to a JavaScript object, which can then be added to the activitiesData state array. 

You could add the objects to the state array one at a time, as soon as each one is ready, or all at the same time, as soon as they are all ready. Choose whichever approach you prefer.
