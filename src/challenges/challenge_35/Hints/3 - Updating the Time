To update the time, you need to execute some code (see previous hints) repeatedly at certain intervals of time. In other words, this is a perfect job for setInterval (although you could also do it with setTimeout â€” either approach is acceptable, although setInterval would probably be more optimal). 

However, to get setInterval or setTimeout to work properly in React, you need to use it inside React.useEffect().
