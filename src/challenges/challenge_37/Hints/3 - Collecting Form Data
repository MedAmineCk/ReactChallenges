While the user is inputting info into the form, that input needs to be stored somewhere, updated as the input changes, and rendered onto the page. If you need to store and update data that gets rendered onto the page, what do you generally need in React?

You need to set up some state for the form data via React.useState().

You also need to update that state as the user enters info into the form. The question here becomes: How do you get data from the form to the state? How do you gain access to that data in the first place?

Another important question to ask yourself here is how should that state be initialized? If you're not careful, you may get an error message. Fortunately, that error message contains a helpful hint!

You need to add an onChange prop to each form element and set it equal to a change handling function that you will also need to create. 

Whatever function you set onChange equal to will automatically receive an event object as its argument. Within the function, can then gain access to the current info inside the element via event.target.value or event.target.checked (assuming you give the event object the parameter name of "event" in your function — however, you can call it whatever you want, such as "e"). 

To know which element the info is coming from, you will also have to give the element a name attribute. You will then be able to access the name via event.target.name. 

You can then use these two pieces of information (the name and the value or checked property) to update the state — being sure to preserve any information from the other form elements that aren't being updated. 

To see all of this in action and get a feel for how it works, it may be helpful to console.log the two pieces of information within the change handling function, as well as the state to which you are setting your form data.
