The text for the to-do list items (the paragraphs with the class name of "to-do-list-item-text") is getting crossed out when the user clicks the "AutoComplete" button, so something must be working right for that aspect of the code â€” and whatever it is, the checkboxes must be missing it. 

What is it? What does the text have that the checkboxes lack? How can you do something similar for the checkboxes that is already being done for the text?
