    Make the app responsive and/or accessible. 
    
    Change the design. 
    
    Allow the user to toggle between the days. 
    
    Display all three days at once. 
         
    Make the app more realistic: 
    
        - Handle additional weather conditions: cloudy, windy, stormy, etc. 
                
        - Use a free weather API (see Resources). 
        
        - Display the current temperature. 

        - These would override some of the original objectives; that's fine!
    
    Keep the logic, but change the theme (for example, make it a daily reminder app).
