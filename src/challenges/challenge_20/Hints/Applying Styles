Remember that JSX elements can receive inline styles as follows:

    <someElement 
        style={someStyle}
    />
    
In this example, someStyle could either be an object with style information, written in the format that React expects, or a variable standing for such an object. 

For more info on inline styles, see the React documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style
