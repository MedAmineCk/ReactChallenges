There's an already existing state that represents whether or not the timer is running. To stop it when timeLeft === 0, you must change its value when that condition (timeLeft === 0) is true, so that other parts of your code will "know" that the timer shouldn't be running anymore.

 Your code should "know" whether or not the timer should be running based on whether timerRunning === true or false. It should be set to false when timeLeft === 0. You can then build the rest of your logic around the value of timerRunning. 
 
 However, you can't just directly write (in pseudocode): "if timeLeft equals 0, set timerRunning to false." If you try this, look at the error message that you get and think about why it's happening and how you could prevent it.

By changing the value of timerRunning, you're changing the App component's state, which means you will rerun all of its code. If you just write a conditional along the lines of "if timeLeft equals 0, set timerRunning to false," that line of code will run again on the next render, which will update state again, and so forth and so on, leading to an infinite loop. 

You need to tweak your conditional to set timerRunning to false only once at the end of the game and not do this repeatedly. Think about it this way: under what circumstances do you want to set timerRunning to false? Is it *just* when timeLeft === 0? Or is there something else you should be taking into account? (Hint: the answer is yes.)

 The whole point of setting timerRunning to false is that at timeLeft === 0, timerRunning is still set at true and should be set to false. Once it is set to false, there is no reason to change it to false again, since it's already false! The other condition you want to check for is therefore the current value of timerRunning!
