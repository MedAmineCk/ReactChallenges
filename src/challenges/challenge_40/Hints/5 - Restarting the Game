At the end of the game, timeLeft === 0 and score === some number (whatever the user scored). To restart the game, these values will need to be reset to their original values when the user presses the "start" button again. Remember that these initial values are already stored at the top of the file, as the variables STARTING_TIME and STARTING_SCORE, so they can and should be reused!
