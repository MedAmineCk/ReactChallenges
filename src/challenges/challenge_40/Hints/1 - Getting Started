If you don't know where to begin, try starting off with a simpler version of the app, and just focus on the timer at first. Begin with a rudimentary version of the timer and then make it incrementally more sophisticated:
    
    1. Make the timer just count down seconds when the app loads. Don't worry about the start 
       button initiating it or about it stopping at 0. Let it tick down automatically and go into negative numbers.
       
    2. Make it only start to tick down if the button is pressed.
    
    3. Make it stop at 0.
    
    4. Make it reset the timer and score if it's pressed again. 
    
    5. Move on to the other tasks, which should more easily fall into place once these main tasks 
       are completed.
