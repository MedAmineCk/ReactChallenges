Add one or more of the following: 
    - A "game over" / "play again" screen.
    - A countdown before the game begins (3, 2, 1, go!)
    - Record and display top scores via localStorage.
    - Allow user to enter his or her name.
    - Take away points if user shoots laser and doesn't hit a target.
    - Allow user to toggle music and sound effects off and on. 
    - Allow the user the customize how long the game is.
    - Create different difficulty levels (more ships and/or ships go faster).
    - Remake the game as a top-down, "shoot 'em up" scroller with a player-controlled spaceship. 
     
Other ideas: 
    - Optimize the timer (see article on setInterval in Resources file).
    - Change the theme.
    - Make the app more responsive.
    - Prevent the laser from continuing to appear if the mouse button is held down.
