First off, Google how to do this if you haven't already! This is what I had to do myself to figure out how to find these values! Then, if you're still stuck, scroll down to line 50 for more hints.

When you Google this, you might end up on a reference page like:

     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/offsetX 
     
     or 
     
     https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_offsetx.asp
     
The instructions you find here are geared toward vanilla JS. They won't work in React. There is something you have to do a little different in React. 

Google this! If you've already done that and are still stuck, scroll down to line 100 for more hints.

Read the React documentation on events (https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html), paying special attention to the concepts of SyntheticEvent and the nativeEvent attribute!

If you're still stuck, scroll down to line 150 for one last hint!

In React, events are wrapped in SyntheticEvent. To get the offsetX and offsetY data, you will need to access them from the event's nativeEvent property, instead of directly from the event itself, as you would do in vanilla JS. 

Again, this is all discussed in the React documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html
