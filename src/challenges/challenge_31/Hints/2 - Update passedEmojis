You have access to all three of the current emojis via the currentEmojis state.

You have access to which emoji the user selected via event.target.textContent. 

From these two pieces of information, you can also determine the two emojis that the user *didn't* select. 

You then just need to stick them onto the end of a copy of the current passedEmojis state array to update the state.
