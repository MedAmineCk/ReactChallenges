If you're not sure about how to do the math for this, do some Googling on how to calculate a rate first . I'm not that good at math, and I had to do that myself to make sure I was doing it correctly! 

If you're still stuck after that, scroll down to line 50 below for another hint.  














































Here's an analogy: if a tree has 250 flowers on Monday and 260 flowers on Tuesday, then the number of flowers has gone up by 10 (260 - 250). This, in turn, represents a 4 percent increase in the number of flowers (the increase, 10, divided by the original number, 250 = 0.04, multiplied by 100 to yield a percent).
