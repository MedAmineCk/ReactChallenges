Here's an example:

    function Example(){
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Welcome to this hint!</p>
                <AnotherExample />
            </div>
        )
    }

In the code above, Example is a functional React component (also known as a React function component). If we wanted to use it somewhere, we would write it as <Example />, using JSX. 
    
The <div> and the <p> are elements. Elements are the building blocks of components. 
    
Components can also be made out of other components. <AnotherExample /> is an example of this. It's a component living inside another component (namely, <Example />).
