If the mouse cursor enters one of the pixel divs, the following pseudocode should be implemented: 

    If the user's mouse button is down (i.e., is mouseDown true), then do the following: 
        
        - Take the previous array of pixel data objects (the pixel state array) and create a new, 
           updated array of pixel data objects. 
           
        - If the pixel data object is the one that corresponds to the pixel div that the mouse 
          cursor entered, then set its filled value to true or false depending on whether wantsToDraw is true or false. Preserve the ID. 
          
        - If the pixel data object does not correspond to that div, preserve all of its data. 
        
        - Make this new array of pixel objects the new pixels state.
