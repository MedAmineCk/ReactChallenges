To access the data in the buttons' data attributes, remember two things: 

    1. These attributes live inside the target.dataset property of the event object that will 
       automatically get passed as an argument into the onClick event handler that you create.
    
    2. Hyphen-separated items in a data attribute name get converted into camelCase (e.g., 
       data-some-name="example" would be accessed via event.target.dataset.someName).
