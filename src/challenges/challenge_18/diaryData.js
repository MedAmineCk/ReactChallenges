We are here to take you away, to a better world." And then they beamed me up to their ship. We blasted away from Earth, entered a wormhole, and were on the other side of the galaxy in just a couple of minutes. We then landed on their planet, Gorzarg 7, where I was met with yet another surprise: on planet Gorzarg 7, the highly advanced society has instituted a universal basic income, and most work has been automated by AI-powered robots! I never need to worry about a job again! What a fantastic way to end the week!`
