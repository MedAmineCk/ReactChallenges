Make the app more responsive and/or accessible. 

Change the design or theme. 

Create a UI to allow the user to create new diary entries. 

Allow the user to save entries as "highlights" and see them all in one place by clicking on the "highlights" button. 

Replace the page-scrolling mechanism for getting from one section to another with a more realistic mechanism (separate pages or conditionally rendered components). 

Create more diary entries and continue the story (just for fun)!
