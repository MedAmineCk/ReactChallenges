I can't really give a hint for how to do this without spoiling another aspect of this challenge! If you already know how to generate the 100 cards, scroll down to line 50 to get a hint on getting the numbers for the cards. Otherwise, complete the other task first and then come back to this!
















































Remember that many array methods, including the map method, have a second, optional parameter for the callback function that you pass into it: a parameter for the index number of the item in the array. Yu can use this number to obtain the number you need.
