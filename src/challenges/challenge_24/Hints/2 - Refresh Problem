If the page keeps refreshing on you, remember that when a user clicks a button on a form, that event is, by default, registered as a submit event, and the default behavior of a submit event is to refresh the page. You have to prevent this default behavior from happening. 

You also have to make sure you are working with the submit event of the form, rather than the click event of the button!
