There are a number of array methods that can enable you to detect if there is a match between a given item (the userInput string, in this case) and any elements in an array (emailList), in this case. There are also string methods for converting strings entirely to upper case or lower case, which allows you to make all of them uniform. You just need to combine these methods together. If you're not sure what they are, do some Googling!
